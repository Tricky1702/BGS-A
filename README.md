# OVERVIEW
Backgroundset (or short BGS) is a framework for images, sounds and music. It ships more than 100 sounds, images for all
standard GUI screens, 117 maps for the LongRangeChart and enhances the overall look and feel of the game. The AddOn is
expandable, highly configurable and compatible to Random Docking Music, Delightful Docking, Better Screens and
Hyperradio. Via patch it can be used with Customsounds, Halsis or Hawksound.

The alternative trumble sounds are outcommented. To activate them remove the comment ("//") for both keys
("[trumble-idle]" and "[trumble-squeal]") in customsounds.plist.
